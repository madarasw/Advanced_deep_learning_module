Assignment: 
You are given the task of building a neural network that predicts whether a 6-digit number is a prime number or not.  
The neural network takes a 6-digit number as input, where each digit is treated as a separate input feature. 
The network outputs a binary prediction indicating whether the input number is prime (1) or composite (0). 
Hence, we can define the function ùëì that takes these 6 digits and outputs the binary 

Network architecture 
‚Ä¢ Input Layer: 6 nodes (one for each digit) 
‚Ä¢ Hidden Layer 1: 64 nodes with ReLU activation 
‚Ä¢ Hidden Layer 2: 32 nodes with ReLU activation 
‚Ä¢ Hidden Layer 3: 16 nodes with ReLU activation 
‚Ä¢ Output Layer: 1 node with Sigmoid activation 

Weights and Biases are gibe in the W.csv and b.csv respectively. 
The network uses cross-entropy loss as the cost function for binary classification. 

Calculate the gradients of the weights and biases. Save these calculated gradients into CSV files named dw.csv and db.csv 
and submit them for grading. These gradient files should have the same formatting as the 
corresponding weight/bias file (follow the exact CSV format specified in Appendix I) but 
SHOULD NOT include the headings. If possible, use np.float32 to control the granularity of 
your gradients; otherwise, round your results to at least 16 digits.

Example: 

If the network has 2 layers
‚Ä¢ Input Layer: 2 nodes (for an input with 2 digits) 
‚Ä¢ Hidden Layer 1: 3 nodes with ReLU activation 
‚Ä¢ Hidden Layer 2: 2 nodes with ReLU activation 

Weights
1.0, 1.6, 0.74                
0.8, 1.4, 0.2                    
0.01, -1.87 
0.0.1, -1.23 
0.0, -0.34 

Biases
1.0, 1.61, 0.74                               
0.01,‚àí0.99  

The output CSV file you would submit should have the same format as above.
